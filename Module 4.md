## What is a region?

- A region is basically geographical area containing data centers, which are interconnected with a very-low betwork latency. 

- Whenever the user needs to deploy something, they need to choose the region in which they would like to deploy. 

- Few services such as variants of VM's/storage are not available in all the regions and few services such as DNS, Azure Traffic Manager, Azure Active Directory don't require the user to choose the region.
