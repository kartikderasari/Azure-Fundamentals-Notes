# Module 4 - Core Cloud Services

## What are Regions?

- Regions are basically geographical areas containing data centers, which are interconnected with a very-low betwork latency. 

- Whenever the user needs to deploy something, they need to choose the region in which they would like to deploy. 

- Few services such as variants of VM's/storage are not available in all the regions and few services such as DNS, Azure Traffic Manager, Azure Active Directory don't require the user to choose the region.

## What are Geographies?

- The whole world is basically divided in different geographies as per the compliances and regulations followed at the locations. 
    - America
    - Europe
    - Asia Pacific
    - Middle East and Africa
- Each region comes under only one geography to follow the rules and regulations applied to the regions. 

## What are Availability Zones?

- Availability Zones (AZes) are basically isolated data center locations under each region which are there to ensure if one AZ is down then others are up & running to keep the services active.
